Random phenomenon modeling with R

# TP1 : General and BoxMuller
During this maths practical, we will have the opportunity to generate achievements according to several laws: Gaussian law, Weibull law, Poisson law.. from pseudo-random number realizations following a uniform law $\mathcal{U}([0, 1])$.
BoxMuller Method

# TP2 : MonteCarlo simulation
We have a European option representing a fi nancial asset whose value at time t is $S(t)$
The goal is to give the average evolution of the value of the asset based on MonteCarlo Method

# TP3 : Markov Chain and MonteCarlo simulation
In a space divided into two compartments A and B we have d balls
With each experiment we draw a number with uniform probability in ${1, ..., d}$. If the ball with the number drawn is in compartment A, then it is placed in compartment B and vice versa.
